# Metrics - Measurements
## Introduction
For measurement and metrics two webpage metrics and the function point methode have been used.
This information can also be found in our Metrics plan here on GitHub:
[Metric Plan](/docs/Metrics/metric_plan.md)

## Results
The metrics show the following results:
### Web metrics calculated with the Lighhouse Test:
- First Contentful Paint => 0.5s
- Largest Contentful Paint => 1s
The overall score is 99. These are very good result. You can find picture below or the  full report as HTML in [Lighthouse Test Results](/docs/Metrics)

### Function points: 
#### What do they mean:
Gives an apporixmate value for costs and required work based on number of user inputs/ouptuts and complexity of the Software (400 - 1600 hours per 100 function points)

#### Our results: 31.1 fp

#### Interpretation: 
- Equates with the above approximation to: 124 - 492 hours.
- This result seems plausible for our project with four people. This number does only account for the development time.
- The remaining 500 hours to reach the hour time of 1000 hours for four people for this lecture are used for the documantation, testing, project management and more. This correlates with our experience. 

### There where no significant improvments between the last lighthouse test an now!
