# MCM - Testing Report

## Introduction
<!-- This section provides an overview of the software testing process and the scope of the testing activities. -->
### Marcel

## Test Strategy
<!-- This section describes the overall approach to testing, including the testing methodology, testing types, and testing techniques used. Highlight which automatic testing tools/frameworks are used for your project -->

### Type of Tests?
We want to focuse on the following tests:
- Unit Test: Testing of most of the implemented functions (js) 
- Smoke Test & Stress Test

### Target test coverage?
Examples:
message shows in the text box.
Behaviour of the page without websocket
Check for empty string.
Many test from the files:
Message and user functions.
=> Around 50% - the correct coverage can be tetermined after the testing campagne 

### Testing tool
Jenkins

### Manage our test cases: Which tests passed (failed on which version?)
In Jenkins: (We tag a test with the last git commit message)
Every Build gets a downloadable test report
