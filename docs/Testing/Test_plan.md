# Our Testing Plan

## Which type of tests?
We want to focuse on the following tests:
- Unit Test: Testing of most of the implemented functions (js) 
- Smoke Test & Stress Test

## Target test coverage?
Examples:
message shows in the text box.
Behaviour of the page without websocket
Check for empty string.
Many test from the files:
Message and user functions.
=> Around 50% - the correct coverage can be tetermined after the testing campagne 

## Testing tool
Jenkins

## Manage our test cases: Which tests passed (failed on which version?)
In Jenkins: We tag a test with the last git commit message
